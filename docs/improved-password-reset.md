# Improved Password Reset Process

## Overview
The password reset process has been enhanced to show users their security question before asking for the answer. This creates a better user experience by helping users remember what they answered during registration.

## New 3-Step Process

### Step 1: Account Verification
- User enters email address and phone number
- System verifies the account exists
- Progress indicator shows 33% completion

### Step 2: Security Question
- System displays the user's specific security question
- User sees their exact security question in a highlighted box
- User enters their answer
- Progress indicator shows 66% completion
- "Back" button allows returning to Step 1

### Step 3: Password Reset
- User enters new password and confirmation
- Progress indicator shows 100% completion
- Password is updated in the database

## Visual Improvements

### Progress Bar
- Shows current step progress (33%, 66%, 100%)
- Changes color to green on final step
- Smooth transitions between steps

### Security Question Display
- Prominently displayed in a blue info box

## Technical Implementation

### Controller Changes

- Automatic cleanup after successful verification
- 15-minute token expiration for security

## Security Features

## Routes

- `GET /auth/reset-password` - Show initial form

4. Enter security answer
5. Set new password
6. Confirm successful login

## Example Flow

```
Step 1: User enters email + phone

Step 2: System shows: "What is your mother's maiden name?"
   ↓
Step 3: User enters answer

## Error Scenarios

- Invalid email/phone: Show error, stay on Step 1

- Session timeout: Redirect to Step 1

This improved process provides a much better user experience while maintaining security and helping users successfully reset their passwords.
